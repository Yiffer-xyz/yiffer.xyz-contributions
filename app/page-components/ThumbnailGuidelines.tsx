          These rules apply when adding comics yourself, but also when you review comics
          uploaded by users. If a thumbnail is not good according to these rules, you
          should change it.
        </p>
      )}
      <p>
        Make sure there are no borders included in thumbnails. Many comics have white or
        black borders around their pages, but these look bad in thumbnails.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the comic has a cover page, this should naturally be used. Otherwise, the best
        thumbnail is <i>not</i> necessarily the first page. Pick a page that represents
        the comic well, without spoiling and preferably without too explicit content. If a
        page has the comic title on it, that's probably the best choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thumbnail doesn't have to be a full page. Sometimes it's better to use only a
        few panels if characters become too small using the full page (examples below). A
        full page is still often the best choice - don't overdo the cropping.
